# 🧬 🔬Biomedical Data Science Journey (Gap Year 2026)

This repository tracks my progress in mastering Python for use in **Clinical Research** and **Genomics**. 

### 🎓 Accomplishments
* **Kaggle: Intro to Programming** - Completed Feb 2026
* **Kaggle: Python** - Completed Feb 2026 (Focus on Loops, Dictionaries, and External Libraries)

### 🧬 Goals for Lincoln/Sunderland
I am preparing to apply these skills to:
1. **Bioinformatics:** Analyzing DNA/RNA sequences.
2. **Clinical Data:** Automating the processing of patient lab results.
3. **Inheritance Models:** Building Python tools to predict genetic outcomes.


🚀  My objective is to be a lab-ready scientist who can also build the software tools needed for modern medical research.
